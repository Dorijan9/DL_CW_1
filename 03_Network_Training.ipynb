        "In a deep learning problem, the weights of a network are updated to minimize the loss in each optimization step. Optimizers define the specific method used to update in each timestep the weights of the network. For example, the vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) only uses the gradient of the weight with respect to the loss in the current timestep $t$, along with the learning rate, to update the weights. However, other optimizers use more sophisticate methods (e.g., keeping track of past gradient updates to use as momentum) to compute the weights' updates.\n",

A nice visualization of such behavior is the following animation, where you can notice some methods, i.e., Adadelta (yellow), and Rmsprop (black) converge significantly faster than SGD (red), which gets stuck in a local minimum.\n",

As a rule of thumb, Adam is usually easier to tune due to the adaptive learning rate, whereas SGD with momentum [has been shown](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07628.pdf) to reach better results when tuned correctly.\n",

Weight initialization is a crucial step in tuning neural networks as different initial values can lead the model to reach different local minima. If your initial weights are too small, the network may have problems learning due to small/vanishing gradients. However, if they are too large, you may run into exploding gradients or you could saturate an activation in the network (e.g. a sigmoid). Hence, we need a proper initialization with not too large nor not too small weights. In [this link](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-notes/initialization/) you can find an explanation of the importance of weight initialization.  \n",

To decide these values we should not use as guidance the performance in the test set, as it may lead to overfitting to that set, and in turn to an erroneous estimate of the performance of the model in non-seen data. Hence, we use what is called a validation set, which we use to tweak the hyperparameters.\n",

        "In PyTorch, there is no built-in *validation split* parameter in `DataLoader`. Instead, you usually manually split your training set into a training and validation set using tools like `torch.utils.data.random_split`. For example:   \n",

Usually, you keep the model with the highest validation accuracy as your final model, and then, ideally, you would test this final model using an independent test set.\n",

By default, PyTorch training loops keep updating the model for all $N$ epochs. To instead retrieve the model with the best validation performance, we can implement early stopping. Early stopping monitors a metric (for example, validation accuracy) and stops training after a specified number of epochs (patience) without improvement. Finally, we can restore the weights of the best model seen during training to avoid overfitting to later epochs.\n",

Data centering (mean=0) can also useful in some settings because the weight initializers used (e.g. Xavier) are derived following a ``mean=0`` assumption about the data distribution, but probably a model trained with [0-1] will usually converge too.\n",
